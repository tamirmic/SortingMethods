This program focuses on two key objectives: gaining hands-on experience with various sorting algorithms and gaining a deeper understanding of the performance differences between O(n^2) and O(n log n) algorithms. It also emphasizes how algorithms with the same theoretical time complexity can still differ in execution time. Six sorting algorithms were implemented including: BubbleSort, InsertionSort, MergeSort, IterativeMergeSort (an optimized non-recursive MergeSort), QuickSort, and ShellSort. A report was created featuring graphs that compare the performance of these sorting algorithms. This report illustrates the efficiency of each algorithm as the size of the vector increases, highlighting the fastest sorts based on empirical data. The report also includes the BigO complexity for each algorithm and a thorough analysis of their relative performance.
